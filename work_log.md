- Should be easy to convert arguments into bayesian arguments


- Argument structure: We should do X, because of *evidence*

- Structure
    - Leaves = evidence
    - Branch points = decisions, all possible outcomes of decisions are splits off of that decision.
    - Trunk = Morals, go backwards from the branches (p
